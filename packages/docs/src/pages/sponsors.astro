        This project has been a labor of love and dedication. While Knip
        wouldn't be nearly as good as it is today without the contributions of
        many awesome developers, I remain the solo creator and driving force
        behind its development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, sponsorships total around $200 per month. While I love to
        give something back to the open source community, this isn't enough for
        sustainable development. Your support is invaluable and helps me
        continue to improve Knip, ensuring it remains a reliable and powerful
        tool for the JavaScript and TypeScript community.
      </p>

      <p>
